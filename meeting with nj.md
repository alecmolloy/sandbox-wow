# Meeting with Narciso Jaramillo 8.16.13

# How did brackets get its start?

It was the perfect moment for it to happen. Because things happened to collide at the right time. About two years ago Adobe realised it needed to move away from Flash. NJ and another guy were looking at the HTML space and had some free reign over thinking about the future of Adobe on the web.

NJ had an idea for a code editor, and threw together a code editor using HTML, which was easier to prototype. He showed it off to his manager, and they thought it was interesting. A lot of Flex, Flash and Air moved into the Edge. They wanted to fill a philosophical roleâ€”HTML was finally catching up with Flash, and we needed to think about the future.

What if we did build a tool that addressed the needs of coders, not the complex Dreamweavers. We wanted people to play inside of our ecosystem.

Text editors are too cheap to make money, and IDEs are too complex and we already have Dreamweaver are too Intellige.

We wanted to have something to do with developers, but

Why don't we make it open source? They decided to go for it because we wanted to challenge this perception problem. There was this goal for revenue, but there was also a goal for thought leadership and credibility. We couldn't establish new tools without establishing our credibility. Protection hadn't gotten us into a great place.


We couldn't make that much money, and we wanted to change perception.

Being engineers it is hard to

Reveunue justifications were hard. You would send money to product areas, but it was difficult to decide where to put money for the suite.

Your goal isn't to sell different products, but to migrate to one product.

You'd come up with a tool that was cool, but not cost efficient. There are not just big things that are going to keep people in, but new small things are going to keep people in the fold.

They formed a pipeline that would do small quick projects that would be tested. 



It doesn't feel like you are actually learning the actual tool. The one about the korning felt lke you were actually learning something. The otherones felt like they were too abstracted. He feels like they should be closer. What if we did tie it into the tool? What if they could actually. If we wanted to sell it more broadly, we would need to get it. How do they

Whatever process that gets them into the tool, we need to measure how they got into the tool. Headlights data can get us this.

If they have the need for the. If people have the need for a tool. How do you define our success in terms that the customer would agree is success. 

Brackets does do thought leadership surveys. Up until now not a lot of them have proceeded past the customer
