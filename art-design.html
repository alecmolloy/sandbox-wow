                <p>I haven't been formally trained in art or design. But my whole life I have surrounded myself with people who have been. I have taught myself in a variety of digital media: phototography, web design, graphic design, music, and video. I call myself a designer, and I call myself an artist, but I still marvel at my friends who devote their life to art and design. Neither of them are my true calling, and I know that, but I can become very passionate about personal and artistic projects.</p>
                <p>My fascination with media has drawn me to focus most of my artistic attention to the net.art genre. I fell in love with the genre through exposure on Tumblr and ever since it has been my primary medium that I work in. I come from a typesetting and layout background, which I love working in still, but there is just something about completely letting go of traditional notions of art and notions of <a href="dance.html">control</a> that appeals to my media side so much.</p>
